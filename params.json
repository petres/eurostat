{"name":"Eurostat Bulk Exporter ","tagline":"Simple GUI which provides Excel Exports, Working Offline, Presets for recurrent tasks","body":"### About\r\nThis program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) which allows [bulk datasets](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/bulk_download) downloads from [eurostat](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/). The downloaded datasets can be filtered, sorted and exported to Excel files. Other export file types will follow (CSV, STATA datasets, R datasets, ...). In addition presets can be created, stored and executed which helps to automize recurring eurostat data exports.\r\n#### Dependencies\r\n* [Python](https://www.python.org/) > 2.6  (should also work with version 3) | Programming Language\r\n* [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt) 4 | GUI \r\n* [openpyxl](http://openpyxl.readthedocs.org/) | Writing Excel Files\r\n\r\nIt's working fine with [Portable Python](http://portablepython.com/) (2.7.6.1). \r\n\r\n#### Submodule Libraries\r\n* [simplejson](http://simplejson.readthedocs.org/) | Writing/Reading JSON\r\n\r\n### Wiki\r\nIf you want to know more about planned features or need a description please read the [Wiki page](http://github.com/petres/eurostat/wiki) of this project.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Get it\r\n#### GIT\r\nSome libraries are included via submodules, therefore the repo has either to be cloned recursively with \r\n`git clone --recursive https://github.com/petres/eurostat` \r\nor the submodules have to be initialized with the command \r\n`git submodule update --init`. \r\n\r\n#### Compressed Files\r\nIn the near future we will provide `zip` and `tar.gz` files.\r\n\r\n#### Executables\r\nMaybe at some point in the unknown future.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Run it\r\n#### Windows\r\n1.  Adjust the paths in the `app\\utils\\config.bat` file.\r\n1.  Convert the `*.ui` files with the script `app\\utils\\convertUI.bat`.\r\n1.  Call `run.bat`.\r\n\r\nIf your are using Portable Python the paths should look like:\r\n```Batchfile\r\nset python = \"D:\\some\\where\\Portable Python\\App\\python.exe\"\r\nset pyuic  = \"D:\\some\\where\\Portable Python\\App\\Lib\\site-packages\\PyQt4\\uic\\pyuic.py\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\nIt is assumed that `python` and `pyuic4` are in your `PATH` environment variable and `make` build utility is installed.\r\n\r\n1.  Convert the `*.ui` files by running `make` in the `app/` path.\r\n1.  Call `./run.sh`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
